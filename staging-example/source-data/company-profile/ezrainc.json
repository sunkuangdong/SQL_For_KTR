These cancers may impact salivary glands, sinuses, muscles, and nerves in the head and neck, each type identified by the specific part of the body affected.\n\nHeavy and frequent alcohol consumption and tobacco use (including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and chewing tobacco) are significant risk factors for head and neck cancers.
