Before long, every organization will have a constellation of agents, working on behalf of individuals, teams, or functions.\n \nWhat excites me most about these developments is the transformative impact they will have on how businesses operate. With 60 percent of the Fortune 500 already leveraging Copilot, we're not just witnessing incremental improvements; we're seeing a fundamental shift in business paradigms. Organizations like Clifford Chance, McKinsey & Company, Pets at Home, and Thomson Reuters are already creating autonomous agents to increase revenue, reduce costs, and scale impact.\n\nInternally at Microsoft, our own success stories are equally powerful. One of our sales teams has achieved 9.4% higher revenue per seller and closed 20% more deals. A team within our Customer Service and Support group is resolving cases nearly 12% faster. Our marketing team is seeing a 21.5% increase conversion rate on Azure.com, and our HR employee self-service agent is answering questions with 42% greater accuracy. This is just the beginning as we reimagine our business function-by-function to be AI-first, and we\u2019ll continue to share our progress along the way.\n \nRead more about today's announcements in my latest blog: https://lnkd.in/gCfTWmtn", "total_likes": 1455}], "follower_count": 23868536, "acquisitions": null, "exit_data": null, "extra": null, "funding_data": [], "categories": null, "customer_list": null}
