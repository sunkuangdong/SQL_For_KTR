I joined Triangle as the stage manager in my first-year spring and was quickly introduced to the Triangle tradition. Triangle has been creating original musical comedy \u2014 written and performed by students, directed and choreographed by professionals \u2014 on the McCarter Theatre Center stage since 1891. I can say that leading the club and producing the show have been truly rewarding opportunities. My heart bursts with love, pride and gratitude for all the people of Triangle who have supported me along the way and become some of my closest friends. They motivate me to be a better leader and make all the late nights at the theater worthwhile. I often get puzzled looks when I tell people I\u2019m in Triangle and I\u2019m an architecture major \u2014 as both require extensive periods of time in a dedicated space: the theater and the studio. Yet, these two important aspects of my Princeton experience overlap greatly. Mounting a new musical and creating an architecture model both start with a blank page, prompting a creative process that can take months, sometimes years, to culminate in a single moment: a live performance or studio review. For me, the thrill of seeing a collaborative project come to life in front of an audience is unparalleled.\"\u2014 Vera Fei '26; photo by Noel Valero '82 *86 More info about \"Pageant Pending\": https://bit.ly/3AD3hAP", "total_likes": 103}, {"article_link": null, "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQEGc281hJr2lA/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1731538141891?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=FWfYPx_LmrEpauIPkMcqZG_bZv2GUjpUBJzwWF4W3qU", "posted_on": {"day": 14, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "From Paris To Princeton! \ud83d\udc4f 9 of our 26 summer Olympians recently returned to campus to be recognized by the home crowd at Princeton Stadium. \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udda4 #OlympiansMadeHere", "total_likes": 469}, {"article_link": null, "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQF5O05v9vqFGg/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1731449703258?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=e_-wy_5i2WJEm75u10iTwRItnyrRxe8Yx4d4k7xrpOs", "posted_on": {"day": 13, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "Juliette C.
