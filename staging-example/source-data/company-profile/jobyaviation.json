Downtown Manhattan Helipad over the East River, showcasing the future of aviation to key stakeholders including the NYC Mayor, NY/NJ Port Authority, and NYC Economic Development Corporation.\n\nThe GEACS charging system is designed to enable the safe and efficient operations of all electric aircraft under development today. It allows for the rapid charging of multiple battery packs, with included coolant for thermal management as well as secure data offload.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g9UqCm-w", "total_likes": 396}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jobyaviation_nyc-it-was-great-to-see-you-at-grand-central-activity-7251974713059479553-XZol", "image": null, "posted_on": {"day": 15, "month": 10, "year": 2024}, "text": "NYC, it was great to see you at Grand Central!\n\nWe'd like to thank the thousands of commuters and visitors who stopped by to see our electric air taxi in-person, as well as key partners and stakeholders who joined us including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Gail Grimmet from Delta Air Lines.\n\nWe'll be back...!", "total_likes": 472}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jobyaviation_joby-is-at-grand-central-terminal-in-activity-7247601182708232193-pHbd", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFOdfCqzxuo6Q/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1727962774589?e=1732752000&v=beta&t=TjTXN3hgv-LHgN3HNNPycnvVUw0fCNOM0PvmiVaKUEI", "posted_on": {"day": 8, "month": 10, "year": 2024}, "text": "\ud83d\udeeb\u26a1 Joby is at Grand Central Terminal in NYC! \ud83d\uddfd \n\nCome by to experience the future of flight with our quiet, emissions-free electric air taxi.\n\nThe Joby aircraft and our virtual-reality flight simulators will be open to the public until Saturday, October 5, during select hours.\n\nCheck out this link for more info: https://lnkd.in/eMaUMjaq", "total_likes": 1429}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jobyaviation_flying-523-miles-emissions-free-jobys-activity-7249426120863793152-ZvLp", "image": null, "posted_on": {"day": 8, "month": 10, "year": 2024}, "text": "It\u2019s Hydrogen Day, and we\u2019re celebrating the tremendous potential of hydrogen to enable regional flight with no emissions except pure water.\n\nThis year, we have demonstrated multiple 500+ mile eVTOL flights with our hydrogen-electric technology demonstrator.
