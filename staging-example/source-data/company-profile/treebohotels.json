{"linkedin_internal_id": "10002306", "description": "We are a 'digital hotel company'. To borrow and extend Steve Jobs' words - we work with the mind of an engineer and the heart of a hotelier. This is best evident in our two business units - \"Treebo Club\" and \"Hotel Superhero\". \n\nTreebo Hotels is India's most loved hotel chain in the premium-budget segment. We have used technology to drive quality control at scale in the economy segment of hotel industry, which was so far unorganised and fragmented. We offer travellers a safe, clean, comfortable accommodation at affordable prices. We are rated 7.8/10 by customers, miles ahead of other players. We have 600+ hotels across 100+ cities under our brand. \n\nHotel Superhero is our brand-new, super-exciting, pure-play technology business. Over the years, we realised that the tech solutions we had built for our own use at Treebo were truly cutting edge and unparalleled in the industry. So we decided to externalise and monetise them as a SaaS business. As part of Hotel Superhero we offer an integrated, intuitive, and extremely powerful hotel management software which takes care of all technology needs of hotels. We offer central reservation system, property management system, revenue manager, channel manager, and a lot more as part of an all-in-one solution. \n\nOur target clients are anyone and everyone running a hospitality business - whether these are boutique hotels, vacation rentals, mid-sized chains, hostels, or large global chains. We have global ambitions with this business and have already developed clients outside India for this business.\n\nHotel Superhero is the business we are actively hiring tech talent for. We are a small team with big ambitions. Joining the Hotel Superhero team could be a great opportunity to get step-up opportunities to build meaty, challenging products. \n\nWe pride ourselves for building a company with a fantastic culture and highly accomplished base of current and past employees.
