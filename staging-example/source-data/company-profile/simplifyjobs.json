It's just really good.)\n\nDeep into my job hunt, I kept reading best practices that mentioned tailoring my resume to each job and writing a flawless cover letter. Great, in theory! But I had to choose between submitting 10 good applications a day and 3-4 great ones. In this market, and with the financial clock ticking, I had to choose the 10. Until I didn't.\n\n-Simplify used AI to tailor my existing resume based on keywords found in each individual job posting. (Take that, arbitrary applicant-tracking systems!) \n\n-It helped me generate similarly keyword-rich cover letters that I could then personalize. (You don't have to, but 100% AI-generated content is painful, obvious, and painfully obvious.) \n\n-It also suggested job openings for me based on some extremely selective parameters. (I'm picky!)\n\nBonus: it cost 40 bucks for a 3-month subscription (the length of the average job search), and I got hired well before the subscription ended. The peace of mind alone was worth the cost, knowing that some fickle robot wouldn't reject me out of hand because I said \"copywriting\" instead of \"copy writing\". \n\nSo, for all my friends newly on the job hunt, save yourself some time and elbow grease.
