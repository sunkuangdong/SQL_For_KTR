{"linkedin_internal_id": "5380768", "description": "The Crick is a distinctive biomedical research institute. We\u2019re committed to advancing, promoting, and sharing understanding of human health and disease. We do that by attracting talented and ambitious people from all disciplines and backgrounds and giving them the support and freedom they need to succeed.\n\nInside the Crick, you\u2019ll discover scientists working to stretch the very limits of what we know about how life works. Their research holds the key to answering fundamental questions about human health and disease. Our bold and innovative research projects bring together scientists and technicians from all disciplines in the pursuit of discovery without boundaries.\n\nWith the support of our partners, we\u2019re bridging the gap between discovery and application to help change lives for the better. And through our dynamic structure, we\u2019re able to develop the science leaders of tomorrow.\n\nThat\u2019s our bold idea, tell us yours.\n\nCover image taken at the Crick by Thomas Angus, Imperial
