What could have been a time of isolation for me instead became a catalyst for some of the most meaningful and fulfilling projects I\u2019ve ever initiated. This experience ultimately fueled my curiosity and motivation to become an engineer and led me to intern at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Vast, a startup building the next-generation space station.\n\nBetween physical therapy and school, I dug into aerospace life support systems research through the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (2x International Grand Awardee), solo-publishing in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) SciTech conference journal my senior year. I also was the first woman to lead my school\u2019s aerospace team, where we became the The American Rocketry Challenge National Champions in 2021.\n\nThroughout my experience as an engineer in a predominantly male-dominated industry, I have consistently found myself being one of the only women in the room, if not the only one. I strive to challenge this status quo by creating spaces where women are celebrated, supported and given opportunities to lead.\n\nI co-lead outreach for the Association of Women in Aerospace here at Berkeley and previously co-founded the AIAA student branch, both of which are focused on providing industry-to-student, aerospace-related opportunities for the UC Berkeley undergraduate student population. This builds on work I did previously with the Portland State Aerospace Society, as I led a four-part aerospace career panel with industry professionals for 400+ high school students during COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nI\u2019m excited to continue paving the way for young women who are passionate about aerospace, while deepening my own skills and expertise as a mechanical engineer.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kara Gaiser (B.S.\u201926 ME) #VoicesOfBE\n\nMore community profiles: bit.ly/3ifpSXy", "total_likes": 55}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dawn-song-51586033_ai-hackathon-llmagents-activity-7254179015358398465-s8ks", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHId1qhyegMDQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1729531052194?e=1734566400&v=beta&t=vdsLkFRRJZJ9E8Wi69NxqYUo80Ik0hu2_UprunwbIHs", "posted_on": {"day": 22, "month": 10, "year": 2024}, "text": "\ud83c\udf89 Thrilled by the incredible enthusiasm for our LLM Agents MOOC\u201412K+ registered learners & 5K+ Discord members!\u00a0\n\ud83d\udce3 Excited to launch today the LLM Agents MOOC Hackathon, open to all, with $200K+ in prizes & credits!\n\ud83d\udd17 Sign up now: https://lnkd.in/edPK6h9p & join us virtually or in person @UCBerkeley! \n\nHuge thanks to our sponsors: OpenAI Google AMD Lambda Intel Corporation Sierra Orby AI (and more to come)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Explore 5 exciting tracks:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Applications: Build cutting-edge LLM agents!\u00a0\u00a0\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Benchmarks: Create innovative AI agent evaluation benchmarks!\u00a0\u00a0\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Fundamentals: Strengthen core agent capabilities!\u00a0\u00a0\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Safety: Address critical safety challenges in AI!\u00a0\u00a0\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Decentralized & Multi-Agents: Push the boundaries of multi-agent systems!\n\nSpecial thanks to my co-instructor Xinyun Chen Google DeepMind & our amazing guest speakers for making this a great MOOC: Denny Zhou Google DeepMind; Percy Liang Stanford University; Benjamin Mann Anthropic; Shunyu Yao OpenAI; Chi Wang Google DeepMind; Jerry Liu LlamaIndex; Omar Khattab Databricks; Graham Neubig Carnegie Mellon University; Nicolas Chapados ServiceNow; Yuandong Tian Meta; Jim Fan NVIDIA; Burak Gokturk Google\nJoin us to shape the future of LLM Agents! \ud83e\udd16\u2728 #AI\u00a0 #Hackathon #LLMAgents #UCberkeley", "total_likes": 459}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/berkeleyengineering_minette-norman-author-and-former-silicon-activity-7260685286169288705-Femy", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5610AQEAmNAf-twB4A/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1731082266686?e=1732014000&v=beta&t=qDtnthIcJC4kKM0jnrGOy77h3OF_s1NVGVsYp7oxzTE", "posted_on": {"day": 9, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "Minette Norman, author and former Silicon Valley software executive, presented her book, \u201cThe Boldly Inclusive Leader,\u201d during a lecture on Oct. 30. \n\nStay tuned for more events in the Berkeley Engineering Book Talk Series!\n\n(Photos by Adam Lau / Berkeley Engineering)", "total_likes": 2}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/center-for-information-technology-research-in-the-interest-of-society-citris-_airmobility-advancedairmobility-aviation-activity-7258178500430290946-nXLQ", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5610AQHhCjAc6Lfihg/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1730484602764?e=1732014000&v=beta&t=QPq1RZPAoHnAXOEtnoYXNHLh5xXs-z5znyoIqedF0w4", "posted_on": {"day": 5, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "Has your team submitted its CITRIS Aviation Prize proposal yet?
