Most of the exploration in future will be in deepwaters which presents huge hope and huge challenges. The current exploration cycle requires a minimum of 5 years\u20143 years for seismic data acquisition and processing (API) and 2 years for drilling and appraisal. Adding another 5 years for asset development in deepwaters, making the first oil cycle extend to 10 years\u2014an unsustainable timeline in this era of energy transition. \n\nWe must compress timelines at every stage. By adopting out-of-the-box solutions in data processing and interpretation, we can significantly accelerate progress.

Collaboration and innovation are essential to meet this ambitious goal and secure a robust energy future.\"\n\nDelivering the welcome address, the ONGC Chairman and CEO underscored the critical need for energy self-reliance to achieve #ViksitBharat.
