We discussed lessons from the #Dragi report, and what it takes to help European companies #scale. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 This is a problem in the #CEE region in particular. While potential is big (in 2023, over 80 startups across 10 CEE countries secured fresh funding to scale their energy-focused solutions in the region and beyond), there are problems with access to smart capital and later-stage funding. As a result, 40% of founders who studied at #universities in CEE do not stay in the same country to found their #startup. \n\n\ud83c\udf0d A roundtable on #energycorridors organized by S&P Global Commodity Insights, where speakers from around the globe discussed the benefits of green energy corridors, how to realize them, and how to combine them with transport and digital corridors. I yet remain to be convinced that much of this can be realized, especially in #Europe, considering #supplychain bottlenecks we already see in existing large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d A Climate #Security Reflection Dinner, hosted by Benedikt Franke of the Munich Security Conference, with an inspiring intervention by Tony Agotha, #EU Special Envoy for Climate and Environment Diplomacy on the EU's role in the world and its efforts to lead on #climateaction. \n\nMy take is that climate Security and #energyresilience need to go hand in hand. While we strive for #netzero, we need to avoid dependencies on any one #fuel, #technology, or country, and also protect our #infrastructure. That's why we created the Energy Resilience Leadership Group at the #MSC two years ago. It's a coalition of corporates and emerging cleantech players to accelerate the deployment of emerging tech.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Columbia University Roundtable on 'Reconciling Climate and #Trade: Principles and Practicalities', with interesting reflections on whether or not a climate and trade agreement is feasible under #WTO rules. Someone said that a future alternative #multilateral approach might not be centered in #DC or #Brussels - if anyone needed a reminder of how the world is changing. I was also happy to meet colleagues from the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, Gr\u00e9goire Roos, Dr. Bryan Scheler, and Paula Schmid Schmidsfelden.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d A great discussion with team of Clean Air Task Force, together with my colleague Alberto Toril Castro. The team around Larissa Lee Beck, Kasparas Spokas and others is extremely insightful and impactful across Europe, the #US, and #MiddleEast, I came out of that discussion with plenty of new ideas.\n\nMore to come.", "total_likes": 88}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maria-a-martinez_chci-activity-7262800021996072961-W7Mn", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQE-PnwgHgHMug/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1731586460997?e=1735171200&v=beta&t=r4uTjmiNTBi23s3gMM1Ps0gJ0zPrrZLFKWoDhKuIUOU", "posted_on": {"day": 15, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "Excited to join the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI)'s Symposium on Energy, Infrastructure, and Sustainability to talk about the ways clean energy technologies benefit the lives of Latinos and what's on the agenda for energy next year.
