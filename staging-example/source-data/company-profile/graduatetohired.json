Aerospace Engineering Student, currently developing CPDGNSS and IMU data processing MATLAB algorithms for a NASA research grant. I improved drone maneuverability by 15% through PID controller and 6 DoF simulations, obtained DOP matrices over 24 hrs for code-based GPS tracking demonstrating reliability of GPS to within 6 m over entire 24 hr period and designed ground-based tracking systems for aircraft while reducing measurement error to 10m. I cut controller response time and overshoot in half through implementation of feed-forward PID controller, improved servo control response through implementation of DOE, and developed inertial tracking algorithms that reduced angle measurement error by 5 degrees. I have supported program reviews while holding meetings with program leaders for multi-million dollar projects.\u00a0I am currently looking to start a full time job in the aerospace industry next summer! #OpenToWork\n\nRelated: https://lnkd.in/g3VxQyHn [Access https://lnkd.in/gnQGpZW8]\n\n#Results\n#EmployeeBenefits #PersonalFinance #NewJob #credit #Insurance #LifeInsurance #PersonalFinance\n#investing #investment #investments #retirement\n#FinancialLiteracy #FinancialEducation #FinancialHygiene\n#BusinessTactics #college #CollegeGrad #CollegeGraduate #CollegesAndUniversities #careers #education #internship\n#networking #BusinessRelations", "total_likes": 6}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/graduatetohired_jobsearch-graduatetohired-activity-7261405927071723520-X5fB", "image": null, "posted_on": {"day": 13, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": null, "total_likes": 0}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/graduatetohired_results-jobsearch-employeebenefits-activity-7256305449874927618-TQlz", "image": null, "posted_on": {"day": 30, "month": 10, "year": 2024}, "text": "BERNIE FLORESCA, M.Sc., Growth Catalyst", "total_likes": 0}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/graduatetohired_careerfair-resume-resume-activity-7242519998005444609-qbjg", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQG8Pg9I69Ae3A/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1726751324706?e=1735171200&v=beta&t=tn8ivl4BEepeZNyNTm6kh5wYKN0Dgsl4E_sbS5aBTIs", "posted_on": {"day": 20, "month": 9, "year": 2024}, "text": "#CareerFair #Resume What do successfully employed Illinois Institute of Technology alum, Kojo Baah, Nelia Borlu, Tony Acosta Hernandez, Marilyn Flowers, and Marut Pandya have in common?\nTomorrow, \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6 \ud835\udff5/\ud835\udfee\ud835\udfec \ud835\udfed\ud835\udfed\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0 Register https://lnkd.in/gsdz-ey9\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf8\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd: \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2 Series [Friday, 9/6, 9/13, 9/20]\n[Exclusive links access: https://lnkd.in/g_89mTFy]\nLecturer: BERNIE FLORESCA, M.Sc., Growth Catalyst\n\nThey all finely crafted their resumes to get the interview!\n\nKojo, \u2018guided me to highlight my \u201cwow-factors\u201d and drew my attention to things I didn\u2019t consider important enough to exhibit\u00a0... he insisted I do my research and homework, with resources ... provided'\n\nTony, \u201cimproved greatly on my resume, helping me outline the skills and projects I'd gained through my experiences at IIT on my resume in a clear, concise, and impactful way ... made up for my lack of professional work in the IT industry.\u201d\n\nMarut, \"... in shaping my resume, ensuring that it effectively highlighted my strengths and experiences.\"\n\nMarilyn, \"\u00a0My resume had an abundance of background information and experience, but he helped me present my best and most genuine self.\"\nhttps://lnkd.in/g3gM5Hrn https://lnkd.in/g-QD55S3\n\n\n#\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddfb \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Think like the Hiring manager and their Job Description.
