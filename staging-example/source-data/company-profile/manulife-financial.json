\n\nIt has been my honour to serve as Manulife\u2019s President and CEO, and I am humbled to have had the opportunity to play a lead role in shaping the future of such an historic company. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team\u2019s many accomplishments. We\u2019ve delivered superior operating results, de-risked our business, and become a digital customer leader in our industry. \n\nMore importantly, Manulife is a radically transformed company today, built on an exceptionally strong foundation and with tremendous momentum that will carry us to even greater heights.\n\nOur performance and disciplined execution have enabled us to deliver market leading total shareholder return and wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the incredible dedication and engagement of our outstanding global team.\n\nPhil and I have worked together for over a decade, and I know that the Board could not have selected a better successor. Phil\u2019s deep expertise and experience, principled leadership, and ability to drive change are exactly what\u2019s needed as Manulife writes its next chapter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs for what comes next for me, I can now pursue some of the many other passions that I have. Of course, I\u2019ll spend more time with my family in Canada and abroad. And I\u2019ll focus on mentoring the next generation of business leaders and innovators, investing in health and longevity, which is a personal passion of mine, and philanthropy. \n\nTo my colleagues across Manulife: thank you for the privilege of leading our phenomenal team. While I\u2019m incredibly proud of the results we\u2019ve achieved, what I will always be most proud of is the culture we\u2019ve built.
