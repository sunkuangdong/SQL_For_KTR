In general, my direct reports have been easy to manage; they are conscientious, competent, seasoned professionals. Among them, but not as easily managed, is a longtime employee with chronic health conditions that have gotten worse and impacted her dependability. She has personal circumstances that have added to her unreliability. We\u2019re an office responsible for producing analytic reports large and small. Some have hard deadlines. I prefer to assign people projects they can invest in and own. Unfortunately, we often need to change focus to respond to changing deadlines and priorities from higher-ups. I try to assign my challenging team member projects with long lead times. Even so, her unreliability means that I have needed to reassign her projects frequently in order to meet deadlines. I spend a lot more time managing work assignments as a result (or just doing the project myself). Sometimes, after I\u2019ve reassigned one of her projects because she says she is not able to work, she shows up. I can either return a project to her, taking it back from another staff member whom I\u2019ve had to redirect from one of their projects, or give her a new, lower-priority project. I\u2019m trying to figure out whether I should be changing my approach to managing people or to managing the work. Any perspective you can offer would be most welcome. I value this employee and her contributions, but she is taxing me.\"", "total_likes": 40}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-new-york-times_the-presidential-election-is-one-of-the-most-activity-7259678673174249472-YSop", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQEA3H-kZ7Uiig/image-shrink_1280/image-shrink_1280/0/1730842273134?e=1732489200&v=beta&t=i4oFpTg3BPkQvEtTZjEBAxiOQC5MW6eeA0jzEKuO0-E", "posted_on": {"day": 10, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "The presidential election is one of the most important nights of the year for the U.S. The same can be said for The New York Times.
