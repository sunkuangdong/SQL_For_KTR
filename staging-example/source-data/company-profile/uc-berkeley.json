Keltner spent much of his early career cataloging and analyzing how emotions, particularly embarrassment, play out across our faces. At Pixar Animation Studios, he's been using his expertise as a scientific advisor on the Inside Out films for over a decade.\n\nWhen he first talked with Pete Docter, the director of Inside Out, he explained that there are 25 emotions that scientists like him have cataloged. Docter, in turn, explained that you can't possibly have 25 main characters in a film, yet the count is now up to nine as Riley's emotions expand in her teen years.\n\nIn this video, Keltner, who has been teaching students about human emotions at UC Berkeley for over 25 years and co-directs The Greater Good Science Center, unpacks the real science behind the Disgust microexpression scene and new characters in the films. \n\n\ud83d\udd17 Full video on our YouTube: https://lnkd.in/grWXDx6T \n\n#InsideOut #InsideOut2 #Pixar #UCBerkeley", "total_likes": 311}, {"article_link": null, "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5610AQGqyIvw6MIMFg/ads-video-thumbnail_720_1280/ads-video-thumbnail_720_1280/0/1730830613654?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WAJ8CsUq7_tvaSgbM42RBn1AWJiSOZN1Pe_pqyhh_s8", "posted_on": {"day": 11, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "Today's the day!
