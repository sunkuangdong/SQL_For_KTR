But soon after starting in the lab, a variety of people from across the Stanford campus began coming to him with similar requests: help with labeling and curating training data.\n\n\u201cAt first, we ignored these requests, thinking - like most did in AI then - that this wasn\u2019t our problem,\u201d says Ratner. \u201cLabeling and developing the data used for training and evaluating AI models was viewed as an upstream janitorial task. All people cared about in AI was the fancy new model.\u201d\n\nTurns out, the process of training models with the right data became far more important than Ratner and his team initially surmised. He now regards data to be the deciding factor in whether an ML project succeeds or fails.\n\nToday, Snorkel AI, which Ratner and four colleagues spun out of SAIL in 2019, works with everyone from Memorial Sloan Kettering to Wayfair to seven of the top US banks. In each case, Snorkel has helped shrink the time to prepare and label raw data from months down to just weeks.\n\nRead on for more about Snorkel's journey, and how the company stayed true to their original insight of the importance of the data during the GenAI boom. \n\nhttps://bit.ly/4fKtDQ2", "total_likes": 79}, {"article_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/leehaney_ai-makes-great-demos-look-easy-but-production-activity-7261403987726213120-4uaq", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFo9KVRdtjvTg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1731083529815?e=1734566400&v=beta&t=2ltuiYlg2T884qF4goRm83nj7qLzBpQ7XItE6Tsfp0Q", "posted_on": {"day": 11, "month": 11, "year": 2024}, "text": "AI Makes Great Demos Look Easy \u2014 But Production Use Cases are HARD\n\nSure, AI demos can be impressive, but enterprises want to see consistent, production-quality AI use cases.
